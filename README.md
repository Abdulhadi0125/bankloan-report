Bank Loan Report
Overview
The Bank Loan Report project aims to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and performance through a comprehensive set of dashboards and metrics. These dashboards provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, helping the bank make data-driven decisions, track the health of its loan portfolio, and identify trends to inform lending strategies.

Problem Statement
To effectively manage our bank's lending activities, it is crucial to have a detailed understanding of various loan metrics. This project focuses on creating a series of dashboards that capture essential data points, including total loan applications, funded amounts, repayment status, and borrower information. The key goal is to differentiate between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on loan status, allowing the bank to evaluate the quality of its loan portfolio.

Project Objectives
Monitor Lending Activities: Track the total number of loan applications, funded amounts, and received payments to understand the bank's lending performance.
Analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Assess metrics such as the average interest rate, average debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and compare month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) changes.
Distinguish Loan Quality: Classify loans as 'Good Loans' or 'Bad Loans' based on specific criteria, such as loan status (e.g., 'Fully Paid,' 'Current,' 'Charged Off').
Visualize Data with Interactive Dashboards: Use various chart types to visually represent loan data, making it easier to interpret and analyze trends.
Provide Detailed Insights: Offer a comprehensive view of loan-related data, including borrower profiles and loan performance.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Total Loan Applications
Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period.
Track Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and observe Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
2. Total Funded Amount
Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
Monitor MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze MoM changes.
3. Total Amount Received
Track the total amount received from borrowers, assessing cash flow and loan repayment.
Evaluate MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.
4. Average Interest Rate
Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and MoM variations.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge financial health.
Compute average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.
Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
Good Loans
Good Loan Application Percentage: Percentage of applications classified as 'Good Loans' (status: 'Fully Paid', 'Current').
Good Loan Applications: Total number of 'Good Loan' applications.
Good Loan Funded Amount: Total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans'.
Good Loan Total Received Amount: Total amount received for 'Good Loans'.
Bad Loans
Bad Loan Application Percentage: Percentage of applications classified as 'Bad Loans' (status: 'Charged Off').
Bad Loan Applications: Total number of 'Bad Loan' applications.
Bad Loan Funded Amount: Total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans'.
Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Total amount received for 'Bad Loans'.
